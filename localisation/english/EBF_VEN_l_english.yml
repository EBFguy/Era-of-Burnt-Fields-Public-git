 POLITICS_GAEL_PUIG_DESC:0 "Gael Puig was once the hope of Venezuela, a reformer who had risen from the ranks of the party to take control after Nicolas Maduro had been assassinated in the years of turmoil of the Venezuelan nation, and all expected him to bring forth a new age for Venezuelan politics, one where the Bolivarian Republic would finally be the democratic and equal nation all dreamed of for years. However, as much as Gael was a well intentioned individual, he was given a Venezuela in shambles even with his inexperience, a Venezuela he had to work to try and make his nation survive.\n\nGael was met with the absolute nightmare of Venezuelan Politics, a horrifying maze of complications, bureaucracy and corruption, which made his dreams of reformism fall flat, letting the young man frustrated with his failures which piled up over the years, and which inspired the people of Venezuela to march to the streets once again. The nation was in chaos, and Gael could only watch as it did. Gael would grow further violent and authoritarian to try and keep the rotting carcass of the Venezuelan nation together, trying to work his way through the system and to clamp down on corruption with military force. Gael's Presidency would grow to become of the most violent ones, the levels of authoritarianism and violence superating even Chavez and Maduro.\n\nNow Gael watches his horrifying creation : A decaying and broken Venezuela, the reverse of his dreams when he was but a young politician starting his career. In private, Gael constantly would break down in tears and go on self-loathing rants for what he saw as him betraying his ideals, but now he thinks its too late for reform, falling into deep nihilism and believing the Venezuelan Nation is doomed to eternally be under the yoke of the Old Guard of the Party, which now controls him as a puppet.\n\n§RGael Puig has died, but his body still shambles foward, 'rulling' what remains of the Venezuelan Nation.§!"

 VEN_The_Perfect_Scapegoat_desc:0 "The USPV's popularity has been totally ruined despite their tight hold over the government thanks to years of economic recession, sky high inflation and mass poverty, alongside a growing issue with refugees and anti-government organizations getting incresingly violent in their fight against the Venezuelan Government. But Puig, the president of Venezuela after maduro perished, had an idea on how to keep the rotting structure that is the USPV in power. By finding a common enemy that both the average venezuelan and the government could hate, and who fits better in this role more than the literal neofascists who now guide Colombia to a dark age? These americanphile, reactionary, deranged, degenerate and maniacal bastards cannot be allowed to destroy the people's revolution! And thus, we must stay united to avoid utter destruction in their hands!...At least that's what the Venezuelan Government say in their desperate attempt to convince the opposition to stop burning down the country."

 VEN_An_All_Venezuelan_Tragedy_desc:0 "Venezuela in the 21st century has always been in a rough state, thanks to corruption, mismanagement of the economy, american sanctions an embargoes and other unfortunate circumstances which rapidly killed its economy and made many poor and unhappy. But even with all this circunstances, Venezuela still had its oil, the blood of its economy, which still made the situation of the nation sort of salvageable, and thanks to the potentials which Venezuelan Oil provided, many believed that there was still hope for the country, that it could finally attain freedom, and that the years of crisis would be just a distant memory from the past.But as the last drop of oil finally fell from the extraction sites, they realized the cruel truth that Venezuela is now doomed, perhaps forever. Now Venezuela is a rotting carcass of its former self, many left the nation as corruption, anti-democratic practices, its completly collapsed economy and growing unrest pressured the millions of doomed souls that were unlucky enough to live through the worst age to be born venezuelan."
