For years they slaved away in labs in the desperate hope of finding salvation.\n\nFor all their hard work they came back, with a Faustian bargain. To save our remaining ice caps and to stop the ever-oncoming storm of water they presented, XL33-PF, a scientific miracle that hardens the very ionic bonds themselves. The cost of their deal was plain: to save the world, the Human world, we must at last destroy the last great empty places of this world, and mankind took it. Yet again placing ourselves, our greed over the wild places, over the Earth."

While North African nations still claim to have control over these regions and actively bring order to them, that is a lie that all the world can see through. There is no order. There is no stability. The recent failure of the 2042 UN Monetary Plan to help support these failing nations has only served to worsen the problems present in this region. With no hope forthcoming for these nations I fear that this so-called "Red Zone" will only continue to expand into the greater desert. Centuries of cultural history, people and communities will be wiped out in mere decades without immediate support from Western nations."

And second, who on God's green Earth thought putting that thing into this was a good idea? We know it does to living things and still, somebody approved its use inside an autonomous weapon.

Sometimes they'd brawl over the border: other times they'd argue over the river. But in the end, they always fought. It was in the 2030s when the fighting became hotter, resources were beginning to dwindle even back then and Kashmir was ripe for oil extraction, so they fought over it, over and over.\n\nSoon enough the fighting got fiercer and words were replaced with weapons. Until one day, somebody made the final move. Nobody knows who fired first, but someone did, and the other side responded in kind, Millions were gone in an instant. I was in America at the time but I'll always remember those Seven Minutes of Humiliation in 2037."
