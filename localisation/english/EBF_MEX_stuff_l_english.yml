 POLITICS_EL_BASILISCO_DESC:0 "§YSupreme Commander of the Legion§!\n§W--------------§!\nNo one truly knows where the man known as 'The Basilisk' truly came from. An elusive figure with a mysterious past, a figure that now terrorizes Mexico with his Legion of the damned. Some believe that El Basilisco was simply a sicario who saw the light after being shot and left to die in the unforgiving climate of Northern Mexico, there, he would survive his wounds and realize that he was now 'blessed by God all-mighty' and his most loyal saint, 'Santa Muerte', which El Basilisco holds a fanatical loyalty to. El Basilisco would begin uniting under him gangs and cartels who thought the same as him, who believed themselves to have the most holy of missions to save Mexico from the degenerates and communists, even if throught the worst methods, and thus, with the followers he gained in the years of instability, 'The Mexican National Legion' was born.\n\nNow El Basilisco is one of the most feared figures in Mexico, being known as one of the heads of the eventual fall of the Mexican Nation as it was once known. His Legion marches unstoppable as the man gets rid of his enemies in a brutal fashion : Submerging them on concrete so that they may be petrified like the Basilisk of legend did to it's enemies. El Basilisco will fight for his dream of a sanctified Mexico, even if he has to cleanse his beloved nation with the blood of degenerates"

 SIL_Narco_Empire_desc:0 "Sometimes, our leader 'El Ratón' looks back at the humble origins of our cartel and questions himself : How we got here? Beginning with Pedro Avilés Pérez as a criminal organization in Sinaloa, we have grown rapidly in the last years thanks to the corruption festering within the Mexican State, until we had enough of being simply a large cartel within the borders of a nation and had one ambition : To become a Narco-State for absolute profit. Our own army, our own laws, our own leaders, our own systems, this were but one of the many things we created as we grew more powerful, until even the army and police of mexico were too fearful to do anything to us. We became untouchable. Now as the mexican central government collapses. we cast aside the façade of being under the jurisdiction of the 'United States of Mexico', no more, we are now our own state in Sinaloa, an all-mighty empire stretching through the West Coast of Mexico. And as our rivals are eventually dealt with and fade away, we stand on top, not as the largest cartel of Mexico, but as the mightiest Narco-State of the World."

This is proven to be true by the fact that there are still those who resist us even if we are the most powerful force here : Remnants from rival cartels, local villagers, ex-soldiers and special forces, all of them united in one purpose, that being of taking out our Narco State. We must be careful to not underestimate these men and women who want revenge against the Cartel, for there are fates worse than death if we let ourselves be taken by them."
