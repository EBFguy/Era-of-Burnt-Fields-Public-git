Four years later their legacy lingers on...\n\nThey left us their great "§3i§!§Gs§!§8m§!"s! §3Nationalism!§! §GUnilateralism!§! §8Materialism!§! Welcome maxims for those with no faith -- without guiding principles of their own. Give yourself up to the whole. No need to better yourself -- §Cyou're American!§! You're number one! Then the only value left is §Gdollar§! value -- the economy. So we'll do whatever it takes to keep it humming along. Even §Rwar§!.\n\nEspecially §Rwar§!.\n\nThe §RPatriots§! planted the seed -- we don't need them around to filter and foster their §Omemes§! any longer. We're spreading them just fine ourselves. Every American man, woman and child...\n\n§RWe're all sons of the Patriots now!§!"
