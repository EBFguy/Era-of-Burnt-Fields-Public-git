 POLITICS_AUTHDEM_GRIGORY_CHKALOV_DESC:0 "§YPresident of Russia§!\n§W--------------§!\nWhen he was born in Moscow in 2015, nobody could have predicted the sort of man that Grigory Chkalov would eventually become. Graduating from Moscow State University with a PhD in Psychology and Political Sciences, Chkalov at that time was full of hopes and dreams and visions for a brighter, better future. Reality would come to disappoint him. Joining the Alliance for Russia's Restoration (ARR) to combat the depredations of the military and restore democracy to a country so long deprived of it, the long years of resistance from 2044 to 2054 changed Chkalov immensely.  Subjected to the darkest parts of human nature and society, from famine to war to oppression, something inside Chkalov began to break. Becoming second-in-command of the ARR in 2048, he finally assumed control over the organization in 2050. By the time the ARR seized control of Russia in 2054, with the help of Russian general Valeriy Zakharov, Chkalov had become a hollow reflection of who he once was.\n\nNo longer did Chkalov believe that it was Russia that was broken. It was the war-addled brain of mankind itself that was broken, an inherent flaw that had ruined everything that mankind had so far built. Establishing the 'Party for Russia's Success' (PRS) out of the ARR after the Cyan Revolution, Chkalov and the PRS have dominated Russian elections in the years since, successfully clearing out much of the corruption of the old Russia and rebuilding infrastructure long fallen into disrepair, while ordering an invasion of Kazakhstan in 2058 to more mixed results. After an attempted coup against Chkalov in 2060 by leftist forces, allegedly orchestrated by Chkalov himself, Russian democracy lies on its deathbed once more."

Coming to doubt the justice of the military's rule over the country, upon meeting Grigory Chkalov by chance a few months before the Cyan Revolution, he pledged his support to the revolutionary forces of the ARR. when the revolution began in earnest, Zakharov was critical to its success, convincing many military officers to stand down rather than support the regime, and personally leading in the division that would decisively win control of Moscow for the ARR.\n\nIn the years since, Zakharov has continued to serve Russia dubitfully as its second hero beside Chkalov. Promoted to the position Chief of the General Staff as a reward for his service Zakharov now leads Russia's armed forces with a guiding hand that keeps the army always ready to be called into action. Such a time came on the 7th of May 2060 when Chkalov ordered for the immediate pacification of Kazakhstan, a region that fell under anarchy during the Water Wars of the 2040s.\n\nFor almost eight months Zakharov has been preoccupied in Kazakhstan leading his troops to victory. Far way from the power plays in Moscow. Zakharov can only watch from the sidelines as his beloved nation falls once more."

This was not a promotion, but an attempt to remove an obstacle to Chkalov's increasingly dictatorial authority. This, combined with the alleged leftist "coup" of 2060, left him distrusting Chkalov, and requesting his subordinate Pavel Nikitin to keep an eye on him. This distrust proved to pay off, as after achieving victory in Kazakhstan, Zakharov carried enough prestige to forcibly remove Chkalov from office before it was too late. Now he finds himself standing in the Kremlin, at the head of a military regime not entirely unlike the one he helped depose all those years ago. This irony is not lost on him, yet he hopes to see his vision for a better, freer Russia through to the end."

Experienced in state and administrative matters, the popular perception of the partnership between him and Chkalov is that he handles the details of governance and daily matters of life in Russia in order to enable Chkalov to focus on accomplishing the grander vision of their government. Although this partnership has for the most part operated very smoothly throughout the years, the more economically conservative Tarasov has always had his disagreements with Chkalov over matters of government spending, and rumors say that privately Tarasov has begun to express even greater concerns about Chkalov's leadership.§!"

When the time came, he joined the ARR along with Valeriy Zakharov, who he still respects immensely for his patriotism and professionalism, and helped bring about the current Russian state. At present, Nikitin is stationed at high command in Moscow to compensate for Zakharov's absence; however, Nikitin possesses a deep distrust of Chkalov which has led to increasing private disagreements between them.

 russia_tree_one.1.t:0 "News Report at Seven"
 russia_tree_one.1.d:0 "As we go to Russia tonight, the situation looks dire. Numerous protests and riots have broken out across the country after the Extension of the December Emergency Decree enacted by Grigory Chkalov 15 days ago. Protesters have labelled the Decree “shameful” and “an attack on the Russian people.” Many protests such as the ones in Samara and Yekaterinburg, allegedly fanned by anti-PRR terrorists and Leftist remnants from the 2060 coup attempt, have grown into explosive riots, forcing police to withdraw from the cities. Chkalov's cabinet is fiercely divided over the Decree and is in complete deadlock, with many expecting a total collapse of the Government within days. The Russian pacification of Kazakhstan is now in its 8th month, with Counterinsurgent operations slowing to a crawl due to supply issues and the harsh climate of central Asia. With riots, rebellious cliques in the Duma and a dead-end war, it appears Chkalov's Government may be on its last legs."

 russia_tree_one.2.d:0 "It was raining hard in Moscow, reflecting the mood of the city. As Tarasov walked down the corridor he could still see burnt-out cars and OMON barricades, protecting the Kremlin from the riots that had been plaguing the city for well over two weeks now. As he walked into his office, Chkalov waved him in, His face showing intense interest in the results of Tarasov's interactions with the “rebel” cliques. “They're up in arms,” began Tarasov. “Smirnova is angry for the first time in years and Kozlov has practically got steam coming out of his ears. They won't let anything more than a parking ticket fee raise get through parliament while the Decree's still active. If we don't do something about them fast, they'll rip the government in two. ” Chkalov laced his fingers in front of his face, staring at Tarasov. “So who's still on our side?” “Not many,” sighed Tarasov. “Grigory, if PRS is going to survive we need new friends. We need to prove that the Party for Russia's success can actually help Russia succeed. And I think you know what that starts with.”\n\nChkalov eyed the touchscreen on the right side of his desk, glimpsing intelligence reports on partisan movements and black zones in kazakhstan."

 russia_tree_one.3.d:0 "Pavel, my friend, how are you? How's Gorky treating you? I'm sorry I couldn't meet you in person, but the situation in Kazakhstan means I need to stay here. I hope the protesters haven't been too harsh on you, I saw what happened to that convoy in St.Petersburg. I must say, I'm disappointed in Grigory's actions in the past few weeks. We both spent 10 years fighting to save Russia, and then not even a decade later he pulls a stunt like this! If I wasn't so tied up I'd go and talk some sense into him myself. Enough grumbling, though. We're making great progress in Central Asia, All the northern rebel cells are gone, and the push into the southeast black zones are going great! We keep this up and we'll be parading around Moscow as heroes by next Tuesday! Take care, Pavel, and a word of advice: Keep an eye on Chkalov and the party. Call me paranoid, but the Pacification mission, the coup last year and the Decree all line up a little too perfectly for my liking…"

 russia_tree_one.6.d:0 "Mansur glanced out the window as the platoon filed into the cottage house. In his youth, before the bad times had come, his mother had told him of a safe means of trapping animals: to offer a big pack of food in lean times of winter, and to hide the trap just well enough that the first inkling they got was the jaws snapping shut around their legs. Waiting for the tinny satellite feed from their radio to clear, Mansur felt a little like the animal in that story. Which snarling beasts awaited their presence - and from whence would the trap spring?\n\nMansur shook his head free of the thoughts. He had his troops to organize, and the billeting wasn't about to settle itself. Unconsciously he fingered his little tin badge, marking him as a Brigadier General of the Free Territory. Such a little thing, a marker of a scrap of a nation clinging on to the land and leaving a swathe of blood. And with it such responsibilities - in theory he was responsible for whole regiments, although the recent fighting had cut him off temporarily from high command. Thousands of lives, each with thirst, hunger, fears, and the taste for blood - and worse. At least this little place had been cleared before the worst of the fighting came to it… He shuddered, thinking of distant Karaganda. Sometimes all a Brigadier General could do, he thought, was order the troops to aim for the head first. A clean death, and no eyes to witness what would become of the survivors.\n\nIt was Karaganda, too, that was on the mind of distant Erasyl, just over the ridgeline. His eyes tight with tears, his scope shaking just ever so slightly, he tracked the man he called the Butcher as he walked into the house.\n\nThe radio buzzed, a cleansing agent for his thoughts. "You have permission to fire when you have identified the target." A pause. "Make the Butcher pay, Erasyl. God is great."\n\nA shot rang out, resounding in the cottage house, throwing itself in echoes against the Kazakh plains until it wavered and died."

 russia_tree_one.7.t:0 "Meeting of Legends"
 russia_tree_one.7.d:0 "Kulikova watched the buzzing tele-screen light up, switching to a brief commercial for Channel One. "In these dark times, there's one light you can look to: the flames of Russia National Energy -" A tinny whine, and the screen bifurcated into two halves. Her eyes widened. Zakharov, the general in the Kazakh territories - and President Chkalov himself. Slipping a little further down into her seat in the darkened apartment, she thought, as all lovers trapped in time did, of her beloved, far away in the land of soldiers and deployments.\n\nIrina, so far away and yet so close in the manner of all warmed-over hearts, seized her mind at once: so she leaned across and forced herself to pay attention to the voices murmuring from the speakers.\n\n"Valeriy, please summarize what you believe the progress of this operation to be. As commander of the forces deployed in Kazakhstan, I will receive and evaluate your report." That voice sounded a little clipped - this certainly wasn't something the politicians were doing off the cuff.\n\n"Yes, President Chkalov." The General's voice must have sounded far better to Irina than it did to Kulikova, for her to follow him with such devotion - her beloved was still so strange, after all these years. "The hostile forces engaged in anti-Russian and anti-human behavior in the Kazakh State's territories have been intercepted and are being dissipated. Our troops tell of high morale, high supplies and a sense of conviction in the duties they are entrusted to perform. Resettlement and logistical supply work to communities in the territories - "\n\nKulikova, swerving between the poles of wakefulness and slumber, drifted amongst the meaningless words - and then a phrase which roused her right back, heart thundering for the first time since Irina's deployment."

 russia_tree_one.8.t:0 "Report on the Three Individuals of Interest"
 russia_tree_one.8.d:0 "The Moscow night, much like the city itself, was restless in slumber. Gray haze hung over the central districts, a formidable, stifling embrace. Citymen traipsed through the streets, flinching from the neon of the nu-clubs and the distant whine of police drones. Chkalov looked out from the anonymous window-room he'd booked, his eyes distant, ever-roving. Tearing his gaze away from the skyline and the scudded clouds, he turned his attention to the report next on the agenda. Three figures, detailed and listed for their relevance to Chkalov's long plan for the Russian state.\n\nMiron Osipov: a man of one idea, and willing, if nothing else, to expend oceans of blood to fight for his beliefs. Shame that his intellect and conviction seemed so lacking where his courage shone bright - he'd worked with Zakharov since the days of the Revolution, and while he'd carved a line straight through the long list of enemies they shared, the report noted a growing interest in a political role of his own. Perhaps he was itching to pay his mentor back - but knowing Osipov, it seemed more likely that his heart ached to escape their shadow instead.  Andrei nodded, making a little note near the margins to understand this man a little better. Such a personality could be led by their thirst, for power and blood, but they could also be used… productively.\n\nAndrei Damian: a political fossil, but never to be underestimated. Perhaps it had been luck that he'd found the forged documents condemning his fellow Communists and New Socialists to treason by association - and that his name had never appeared on the files. More likely, however, Damian had become a survivor the same way he'd maneuvered his way through the chaotic Revolutionary days - through skill, cunning and a talent for undercutting potential opponents before they disposed of him. Andrei mentally relegated him to political work - who better than a Communist to play the people's fiddles?\n\nChkalov's eyes widened - the report's last name pulled him into the swamp of the Project. Loyal, honest, a driven taskmaster - and the Project - he mouthed through the words - ever closer to completion. Giddy, Chkalov fell away from the report and its boring words - his mind on private matters, and the Moscow skyline a theatre for his dreams."
