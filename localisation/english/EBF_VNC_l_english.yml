 VNC_end_new_years_on_the_shining_island_desc:0 "Citizens rejoice! The sun shines on a new Year, so many times brighter than the last and yet the old issues remain. Disunity in the government, an uneasy place in Europe and a stagnating Old Venice to name but a few. However, a new year means a new us, and a new way for us to show the world our worth."

 VNC_new_orders_from_richford_city:0 "New Orders from Richford City"
 VNC_new_orders_from_richford_city_desc:0 "As a department of the Habeo Ideam corporation, we hold our loyalty to the headquarters in the vainly named city of Richford City. Richford City is similar to us being a corporate-run Utopian but while we get our name from geography Richford city is named after our founder Domonic Richford. Today more orders have come in as they are known to do, these orders should be followed and followed quickly, we wouldn't want to upset the higher ups."
 VNC_courtship_of_three_interests:0 "The Courtship of the Three Interests"
 VNC_courtship_of_three_interests_desc:0 "The newest order from Richford via Plan HINV Order 07 Iteration 05 Directive 01 orders that we ensure the happiness and satisfaction of 3 important figures. These are Milana Marcello, leader of the Self Defence forces, Carol Holmes, Director of Placements for the Initiatives, and Niccolò Manna, leader of our local collaborators in Old Venice. These 3 help with the smooth running of our operations to make sure we have high profits to send back to Richford. Their cooperation is vital to keep the higher ups in good spirits to keep our jobs."
 VNC_situation_with_selfdefence_force:0 "The Situation with the Self-Defence Force"
 VNC_situation_with_selfdefence_force_desc:0 "The New Venetian Self -Defence forces are the “Army” of New Venice, responsible for counter-terror operations, defending the borders and keeping order. Made up of a mix of PMC contractors, security brigades funded by Haebo Ideam and even civilian volunteers, the SDF is run by Milana Marcello. While no-one can doubt the SDF's effectiveness in combat, Krennic and Marcello have butted heads over the SDF's doctrinal direction and even Krennic himself has questioned how loyal they will be if war is to break out."
 VNC_reinforce_mainland_divisions:0 "Reinforce the Mainland Divisions"
 VNC_reinforce_mainland_divisions_desc:0 "We hold a special place in the minds of the mainland warlords. This spot is not an enviable one though, many see us as nothing more than an illegitimate corporate state exploiting the region for profits. Many warlords dream of conquering us in an attempt to remove Habeo Ideam influence in the region. This cannot be allowed though as we must continue to further our goals and help the people of New venice. If we wish to survive to help the people of Italy and protect Habeo Ideam assets we must reinforce our mainland divisions. These divisions are our first line of defense against the savage warlords and they must be accommodated."
 VNC_no_better_place_protect_then_home:0 "No Better Place to Protect Then Home"
 VNC_no_better_place_protect_then_home_desc:0 "Even though the situation on the mainland is bad, giving Marcello even more power would be more jeopardising to Krennic's plans than anything else. As such, the SDF will withdraw most forces from the mainland and fortify New Venice. This will ensure that the great project will never fall to outside threats, even if some of the new troops are less effective."

 VNC_fine_dining_with_woman_with_gun_desc:0 "While they disagree on almost everything and despise each other with a passion, Krennic and Milana still are on the same side and need each other. It will be important to ensure that she stays on our side, however painful that might be."

 VNC_prioritise_public_cities_infrastructure_desc:0 "The Public Cities outside of New Venice are in a saddening state. The cities lie in filth and disarray, while we build our wonderful city we have forgotten to care for the people that helped us make it. This cannot continue with a clean conscience. Should we be respected as a civilized people we must care for all cities under our influence, not just New Venice. By diverting resources temporarily, the Public Cities can be restored so they are no longer an ugly stain on our record. Unfortunately though diverting resources will likely displease Carol so we must tread carefully."
 VNC_hasten_operation_shining_island:0 "Hasten Operation Shining Island"
 VNC_hasten_operation_shining_island_desc:0 "Operation Shining Island is the internal name for the preparation of New Venice to become a shining beacon of light over the darkness of Europe. Unfortunately though the project has progressed less than favorably as of late. Through bureaucratic drain and unexpected setbacks we need to significantly hasten progress. This needs to be remedied quickly, by putting extra resources in to hasten the project it would help in finishing on time. Along with this Carol would be very pleased by the extra resources at his disposal."

 VNC_mid_point_between_wise_unwise_desc:0 "It is no secret that most Habeo Ideam staff do not like Manna and his fellow collaborators. They are viewed as cowards who focus more on women and drugs than they do assisting the state. Despite this they are loved by Italians and are unfortunately useful to our national security. As a result of this importance, as much as it pains us we must keep them happy. Though some have concerns about allowing their blatant laziness to continue they are the one thing Italians do not despise about us. Should we keep Manna happy we should hopefully keep the public happy."

 VNC_refocusing_the_efforts_on_new_venice_desc:0 "The latest order from Richford has arrived with much the same method as previous orders. Under Plan HINV Order 07 Iteration 05 Directive 02 we are ordered to refocus our time on New Venice. With the affairs of the major players squared away we have more time and energy to put our full attention into the city. it is imperative to focus on the wonder of modern engineering we govern. Though the city has finished construction it still needs extra love to become the wonder it is destined to be. Some construction has been rough around the edges and with more direct orders to the workers the city can be perfected and gain the respect it deserves."
 VNC_begin_preliminary_planning_for_extra_construction:0 "Begin Preliminary Planning for Extra Constructions"
 VNC_begin_preliminary_planning_for_extra_construction_desc:0 "One of the greatest boons of New Venice is the ease at which the city can be expanded and built upon. Because of the city being fully planned and using the most advanced construction efforts known to man, adding on couldn't be easier. These Auxiliary functions as they are called will not only make us a golden light of civilization, but also have massive economic bonuses if we manage them properly. Though the city is new it is never too early to begin planning for the next step in expanding the city. The more we expand the better we can provide for our people.""

 VNC_richford_gift_desc:0 "As Plan HINV Order 07 Iteration 05 Directive 02 comes to a close, Richford has elected to send us a gift, a rare sight if there ever is one. Through our effective planning and use of resources we have managed to succeed in Plan HINV Order 07 Iteration 05 Directive 02 and construct a city of dreams. Without any formal message from Richford we have little to no idea what the gift is though. Some are cautious of the gift as it is a very rare thing for Richford to do but he would never lead us astray. The anticipation is simply too much to bear. What could the gift possibly be? There is only one way to find out."
 VNC_greatest_boon_them_all:0 "The Greatest Boon of Them All?"
 VNC_greatest_boon_them_all_desc:0 "Richford has not been one known to get heavily involved in his projects. For most of New Venice's construction he has left management in the hands of Krennic. While it has worked for both parties, this hands off method has been temporarily dismissed. Richford sent a boon we can not ignore in the way of a list of advanced constructions he is willing to help us do. While this is out of the ordinary it is most appreciated, it is clear Richford is very dedicated to New Venice. In the message about this offer Richford suggested that should the constructions succeed New venice would be able to rule Europe for Habeo Ideam. Ultimately even if some may see it as harsh, civilization of Europe under Habeo Ideam is the end goal, with these options from Richford we shall succeed in this goal. "

 vnc.1.t: "The Wise Hall Initiative"
 vnc.1.desc: "With another year of his life gone Harold Krennic has ruled New Venice as Richford's representative since 2055 with the public goal of reconstructing Venice after its unfortunate abandonment to the ocean. Following Europe's collapse, however, New Venice transformed from a boorish restoration project to the ultimate goal of Richford and Harold, the Wise Hall Project. A series of walled cities purpose-built to create and propagate the most extraordinary minds ever created by mankind. With tales of future orders coming from Richford city, Harold awaits the call from his boss."

 vnc.2.t: "The Public Cities Initiative"
 vnc.2.desc: "As Harold continues to wait for Richford's new directives for the new year Krennic's eyes wander across the Venitian waters towards Old Venice. Whilst New Venice is a utopian city of lights and marble, across the sea and you'll find only hardship and brutality the Self Defence Force keeps the mainland under our control, ordering villages and towns to hand over and then extract any important and valuable resources from the region they lie within. Ultimately these resources are extracted to be returned to New Venice at which point they can be used to expand the city and make it prosper evermore."
 vnc.2.a: "..."
 vnc.3.t: "For the Ears of the Director of the Habeo Ideam Offices in New Venice"
 vnc.3.desc: "Domonic Richford calls Harold Krennic giving him his new orders for the year: for too long has New Venice's construction and preparation been stalled, as such new resources are been allocated to the New Venice branch alongside the order for Krennic to shore up his alliances within New Venice. It is the beginning of the end for New Venice's times of peace."

A woman who for much of her life has met only hardship Milana leads her men with the same harshness that forged her during her early years. Her early life was populated with only suffering as she was abandoned by her parents after fleeing the original Venice's destruction leaving her to languish for years in orphanages across Europe, just one of the many young children who suffered under Europe's byzantine bureaucracy. Since then she has blamed the European Federation's insistent need to mix and match ethnicities and cultures for causing the degradation of Europe and then its collapse. Because of her desire to complete her own goals, she often butts heads with Krennic. Krennic must now decide if he should reinforce the SDF (giving her more power) or improve the defence of New Venice proper."

This comes in the form of shared power and an improvement for the SDF."

This monster is the man who helms the Public Cities and Wise Hall Initiatives creating vast intricate lists detailing everything about every citizen of New and Old Venice, their intellect, loyalty and usefulness. After that has been analysed the individuals are set to their proper place within the nation. Carol and Krennic both hold no ill will towards each other however Carol believes himself to be Richforrd's most loyal and greatest follower meaning he is always wary of disloyalty from those within his ranks."

Should they §Rfail§! the faction with the highest §YPower number§! above the current §YDirector§! can attempt a §RCoup Attempt§!, a fifteen day period in which the current director and attempted couper can make a series of rapid §YDecisions§! to resolidify their Power number and take the opposing side's Power away. However, for every coup §YThe Rodeo of New Venice§! and its associated §Rdebuffs§! will increase reducing your capacity to fight effectivly.\n\nThe forces of the Council never sleep and are always looking to one up each other and to present themselves as useable to §YRichford§!, expect to have close calls and even a few §Yun-desired coups§! against you."
