With few options left the cornered SciSocs and Holy Orderists are growing reckless."

A founding member of the European Federation's biggest communist party, the European All-Workers' Congress the collapse of his party during the Civil War crackdowns forced him further into political extremism as his friends and allies were forced into prisons or turned up dead in the streets. Forced into hiding because of this Favre emerged two years as one of Occitania's founding members and as a changed man. But still, Favre is undeterred, his ideology and his mind might have changed but his dedication to the worker's cause is unshakable.§!"
 OCC_Urilla_Deniau_min_desc:0 "§YMistress of the Order of the Holy Worker's Soul\nBelief in the Worker's Soul\nMother of Man§!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_idea_OCC_Urilla_Deniau_large\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--------------\n§LLong before becoming the founder of the Order of the Holy Worker's Soul, Urilla Deniau was a nun who lived in a monastery in southern France. Seeing firsthand the suffering caused by the ECW and the mass mutinies that followed, her faith in the lord was shaken by the indiscriminate bombings and killings perpetrated by out-of-control soldiers against her fellow nuns. Fleeing from the violence to Toulouse she hid amongst the ruins, hoping to survive.\n\nWith her convent destroyed and her faith weakened Urilla isolated herself from the world wondering where it all went wrong. The product of her contemplation was the Order of the Holy Worker's Soul, a humanist religion focused on improving human lives and creating a new idol of worship, mankind's ingenuity, faith and industriousness. Finding power in Occitania's Supreme Politburo Urilla's order has found a small yet growing niche within Occitania's society.§!"

Joining a resistance cell soon after, Giorgio fought against Gabriel's military dictatorship in southern France every step of the way losing close friends and allies every step of the way.\n\nAfter fighting hard for a year only to see his hard work go to waste with Europe's collapse, Napolitani's transformation was completed in 2058 with the formation of the SciSoc Group, a 'research' organisation focused on finding and dispersing the most optimal traits within Humans. Using his position as one of Occitania's most powerful individuals the success of SciSoc might just be within arm's reach.§!"
